Here's a simple Python code for generating the Fibonacci sequence:                 def fibonacci(n):             fib_sequence = [0, 1]             while len(fib_sequence) < n:                 fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])             return fib_sequence[:n]                  # Example: Print the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence         n = 10         result = fibonacci(n)         print(result)"},{"human":"測試","assistant":" That's a great code! It's very efficient and generates the Fibonacci sequence correctly."}];
